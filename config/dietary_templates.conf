# Configuration Notes

## How to Use This File:
1. This file documents the 8 built-in templates
2. Templates are hardcoded in `dietary_period_service.py`
3. To add custom templates, modify `get_suggested_protocols()` method
4. Future versions may support loading from this config file

## Template Structure:
- **name**: Display name in UI
- **type**: Category (time_restricted, meal_timing, intermittent_fasting, low_carb, calorie_cycling, portion_control, food_elimination)
- **description**: Brief explanation shown in UI
- **suggested_duration**: Recommended trial period
- **benefits**: Positive aspects
- **considerations**: Challenges or warnings

## Adding Custom Templates:
To add a custom template, edit `src/services/dietary_period_service.py`:

```python
def get_suggested_protocols(self):
    return [
        # ... existing templates ...
        {
            'type': 'custom',
            'name': 'My Custom Protocol',
            'description': 'Description here',
            'example_duration': '2-3 weeks'
        }
    ]
```

## Template Guidelines:
- **Duration**: Most effective with 2-4 week trials
- **Simplicity**: Easier templates = better adherence
- **Safety**: Always consult healthcare provider for major dietary changes
- **Tracking**: Log weight regularly to measure effectiveness

## Evidence-Based Templates:
All templates are based on published nutrition research:
- Time-restricted eating: Circadian biology studies
- Intermittent fasting: Metabolic health research
- Low-carb: Carbohydrate metabolism studies
- Portion control: Behavioral psychology research
- Plant-based: Environmental and health studies

**Version:** 2.2
**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025
**Templates:** 8 built-in protocols
**Future:** Load from config file (YAML or JSON)
